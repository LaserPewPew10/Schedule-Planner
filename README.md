# Schedule-Planner

Worker with Melissa Mercado, James Kim, Tiffany Lombardi, Mike Haber, Nathan Pecchia and Camrynne Sullivan.

Started pesudo coding the blocks of code. Starting from the time of the day to implementing the rendering of the said colors to the correlated hours.
It was challenging to find a way to utulize jQuery for the function of rendering the different colors in the schedule planner.
We also added another block of jQuery code for the implementation of having the local storage added for whatever the person wanted to save within their to-do list.
We also added an array of timeobjects for the syntax of "this" to be used for the text box's to be shown with different colors again.

At the end of stating the code, i made an arbitrary test to see if the text box with the saved function as well as the rendering of color and it ultimately worked.
